    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p> Hey, I'm RedCat. I live in Dallas Texas, in the United States of Freedom </p>
    <p>I have, like, a ton of hobbies: I love building computers and repairing them, plus also coding and programming websites (primarily in C#, I'm trying to learn Python as well)
    I also play games a lot (almost exclusively on PC), such as Apex, Valorant, Minecraft, and RDR2.
    Another thing I enjoy doing is building stuff, irl, physically. I have a couple power drills and 
    I enjoy repairing and creating the most wack solutions to simple problems.
    </p>
