About me
Hey, I'm RedCat. I live in Dallas Texas, in the United States of Freedom

I have, like, a ton of hobbies: I love building computers and repairing them, plus also coding and programming websites (primarily in C#, I'm trying to learn Python as well) I also play games a lot (almost exclusively on PC), such as Apex, Valorant, Minecraft, and RDR2. Another thing I enjoy doing is building stuff, irl, physically. I have a couple power drills and I enjoy repairing and creating the most wack solutions to simple problems.
